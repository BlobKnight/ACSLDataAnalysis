## Summary

This program uses BeautifulSoup and Pandas to request the score data for the 2022 ACSL Finals competition, and converts the data into a histogram that can be analyzed. 

## Instructions

Uncomment the definition of the URLs for the Division you want to analyze (Senior, Intermediate, or Junior). Once the code has been ran, images of the histograms of the Programming, Shorts, and Total score will be outputted in the program folder. The medians of each section will be outputted into the console as well.
